# Mapty-App

I tried to implement the object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript that I learned in this project. It is an application where I attempted to apply concepts such as encapsulation and inheritance. Additionally, I used the class structure introduced in ES6. By using the Leaflet.js library, I tried to reinforce my understanding of how to add a library to a project and read its documentation.

To briefly describe the project:

Firstly, we use the Geolocation method to retrieve the user's location and display it on the map. Then, when we click on a point on the map, we make the hidden form in the side-bar visible, showing the coordinates of the clicked point. By entering the required data in the form and pressing the Enter key, we create a marker on the map using the \_newWorkout method I wrote. Additionally, we hide the form in the side-bar and perform the listing operation there. We store the data in the browser using the localStorage function. Later on, we can perform these operations when we want to modify an element.
